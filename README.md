# AllAboutJava
Everything I've learned about Java will be recorded under this repo, including thoughts, knowledge, problem solutions, gains, algorithm problems, APIs, new features, and coding examples

Code knoeledge writing format:
1. If is related to specific class (such as Arrays or Character)
  1. Create file with class name if file with class name does not exist
  2. Add details about what I learned according to numbered lists rule
2. If related to conversions between data structures
  1. Create file under DataStructConversions folder


(To be continued...)
