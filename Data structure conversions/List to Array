According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042434/converting-arrayliststring-to-string-in-java

List<String> list = ..;
String[] array = list.toArray(new String[0]);

The toArray() method without passing any argument returns Object[]. So you have to pass an array as an argument, which will be filled with the data from the list, and returned. You can pass an empty array as well, but you can also pass an array with the desired size.

Important update: Originally the code above used new String[list.size()]. However, this blogpost (see original link above) reveals that due to JVM optimizations, using new String[0] is better now.
